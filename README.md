# Greeting Project

This is my first Python project  
It asks for your name and age, then prints a greeting.

## How to Run
In your terminal, run:

```bash
python3 greeting.py
What’s your name? Jake
How old are you? 26
Hi, my name is Jake and I am 26 years old.
```

That’s it. Just paste that directly into your **README.md** file and commit/save. It’ll render with:  
- A nice title (`# Greeting Project`)  
- A description  
- A code block for the command  
- An example interaction
